# Personal Bill Tracker â€“ Design & Colors

The Personal Bill Tracker app boasts a modern, visually striking interface designed for clarity and engagement.

## Color Palette

- **Dark Mode:**
  - Deep, dark backgrounds provide a sleek canvas.
  - Vibrant cyan and magenta accents create a neon-like glow, making key elements pop.
- **Light Mode:**
  - Clean white backgrounds ensure readability.
  - Accents in deeper cyan and magenta maintain visual interest and accessibility.

## Visual Effects

- **Gradient Effects:**
  - Smooth transitions between cyan and magenta are used for headings, buttons, and highlights, giving the UI a dynamic, energetic feel.
- **Glass Morphism:**
  - Translucent cards with subtle backdrop blur create a modern "glass" effect, adding depth and sophistication to the layout.

This combination of bold colors, gradients, and glass morphism delivers a contemporary, user-friendly experience that makes managing bills both intuitive and visually appealing.
